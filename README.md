**Summary of the Completed Project: Comprehensive Customer Retention Analysis for a Global Furniture Retailer**

We have completed a full-cycle analytical project aimed at understanding and improving new customer retention for a global furniture retail company. This task was of strategic importance, as retaining existing customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

**Project Stages:**

    Data Definition and Extraction:

        A business question was posed: "How well do we retain new customers in the weeks following their registration?"

        To answer this question, a complex SQL query was written to extract user registration and subsequent activity data from the database.

    Performing Cohort Analysis:

        Cohort analysis was the key analytical method. Instead of just looking at the total number of active users, we grouped them into cohorts based on their registration week.

        This allowed us to track the lifecycle of each individual group of new customers and compare their behavior, which is a much deeper approach than analyzing general metrics.

    Data Processing and Aggregation:

        The SQL query processed the raw data, calculating the number of unique active customers for each cohort by weeks since their registration (Week 0, Week 1, Week 2, etc.).

        The result was a clean, structured dataset ready for visualization and interpretation.

    Visualization and Interpretation:

        The aggregated data was visualized using Tableau, which transformed a table of numbers into an intuitive and understandable chart (a cohort chart).

        The visualization made it possible to instantly see key trends:

            A sharp drop in activity after the first week, which is a critical point for customer churn.

            The stabilization of behavior among those who remained, indicating the formation of a loyal core.

            Slight differences between cohorts, enabling the search for reasons for success or failure in specific periods.

    Formulating Business Conclusions and Recommendations:

        Based on the analysis, we drew business-oriented conclusions about the behavior of the furniture store's customers, rather than purely technical ones.

        The final stage was the development of specific, actionable recommendations aimed at solving the identified problems. The recommendations concern improving the first-time user experience (onboarding), re-engagement strategies, and analyzing successful marketing campaigns.

**What Task Did We Accomplish?**

We transformed raw customer activity data into a strategic tool for business decision-making.

In simple terms, we:

    Identified the "leaky bucket": We pinpointed the stage where the company loses the most new customers.

    Quantified the problem: We provided precise figures showing that over 50% of new customers do not return by the second week.

    Proposed a "remedy": We developed clear recommendations that can help "patch the hole" by improving communication with customers during their most vulnerable period.

Therefore, this is not just a technical data analysis, but a comprehensive analytical study that enables a global furniture retailer to make informed decisions to increase customer loyalty and, consequently, boost revenue.
